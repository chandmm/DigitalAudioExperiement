# DigitalAudioExperiment
## Description: 
Experimentation with wiriting my own Audio player. 
Atleast that is how it currently looks like. Maybe I will have time to do more than just mp3's.

## Dependencies
Uses library from my other project WpfAudioControlLibrary
URL: https://github.com/chandmm/WpfAudioControlLibrary

WpfAudioControlLibrary should be built then its dll's referenced in this project for this project to work.

### Current Status:
Early development only. Not functional as an audio player.


## TODO: 
Add more content to this readme file.
