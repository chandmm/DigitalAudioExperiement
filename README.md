# DigitalAudioExperiment
## Description: 
Experimentation with wiriting my own Audio player. 
Atleast that is how it currently looks like. Maybe I will have time to do more than just mp3's.

## Dependencies
Uses library from my other project WpfAudioControlLibrary
URL: https://github.com/chandmm/WpfAudioControlLibrary

WpfAudioControlLibrary should be built then its dll's referenced in this project for this project to work.

### Current Status:
Early development only. Functional as an audio player only with external mp3 decoding library currently in a private repository.
Mp3 decoding library currently work in progress to bring into public repository.


## TODO: 
- [Done] Bring private mp3 decoding library into public repository - currently work in progress.
- Add more content to this readme file.
